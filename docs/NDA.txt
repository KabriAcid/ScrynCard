2. Protect Yourself

Before disclosing deep tech details:

Prepare an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) or MoU stating that your concept and design belong to you.

File at least a provisional trademark or business name for SkrynCard under CAC — even before you start development.

Keep dated copies of all your drafts and pitch decks as proof of ownership.

3. Have a Mini Pitch Deck (10 slides max)

Include:

Problem: chaos, fraud, and violence in physical campaign cash distribution.

Solution: scratch-card-based digital redemption system (SkrynCard).

How it works: flow from printing → sharing → redemption.

Revenue: service fees + card issuance + future fintech expansion.

Impact: transparency, safety, employment creation, financial inclusion.

Market potential: every politician, party, NGO, or charity drive.

Competitive edge: proprietary anti-counterfeit + secure payout pipeline.

Legal compliance: KYC/AML-ready, partner banks, neutral positioning.

Team: you + partners/advisors.

Ask: what you want from the politician (endorsement, investment, pilot).
